## Introduction
The **Browser Artifacts Forensics Tool** is a specialized application designed for digital forensic investigators. It aids in extracting, processing, and analyzing browser artifacts from privacy-centric browsers like Brave. The tool also supports Prefetch file analysis to track program execution patterns, enabling investigators to construct detailed activity timelines.

## Features
- Extracts and decrypts browser artifacts:
  - Bookmarks
  - Browsing history
  - Local storage
  - Session storage
  - Saved passwords
- Performs Prefetch file analysis for execution patterns.
- Outputs data in multiple formats:
  - CSV
  - JSON
- Integrates seamlessly into forensic workflows.

## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Dependencies**:
  - **Go**: To run the core application.
  - **Python 3.8+**: For additional analysis modules.
  - **PECmd**: For Prefetch file analysis.

## Installation

### Go Application Setup
1. **Download and Install Go**:
   - Visit [Go's official website](https://golang.org) and download the latest version.
2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Run: `go version`
3. **Build the Application**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.go`.
   - Run: `go build -o forensic_tool main.go`

### Python Setup
1. **Download and Install Python**:
   - Visit [Python's official website](https://python.org) and download the latest version.
   - Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is selected during installation.
2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Run: `python --version`
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the directory with `requirements.txt`.
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### PECmd Setup
1. **Download PECmd**:
   - Download the tool from [here](https://download.mikestammer.com/net6/PECmd.zip).
2. **Setup PECmd**:
   - Copy `PECmd.exe` and `PECmd.dll` to the tool's working directory.
   - Add the directory to your system's PATH.
3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Run: `PECmd.exe -h`

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface
- **Go Application**:
  ```bash
  ./forensic_tool --input=<path_to_browser_artifacts> --output=<output_directory>
  ```
- **Python Module**:
  ```bash
  python main.py --artifact=<artifact_type> --input=<path_to_data>
  ```

### Prefetch Analysis
Analyze Prefetch files using PECmd:
```bash
PECmd.exe -f <path_to_prefetch_file> -o <output_directory>
```

## Artifact Categories
- **Bookmarks**:
  - Extracts URLs and metadata.
- **Browsing History**:
  - Retrieves user activity logs.
- **Local Storage**:
  - Accesses key-value pairs stored locally.
- **Saved Passwords**:
  - Decrypts and analyzes encrypted credentials.
- **Prefetch Analysis**:
  - Investigates program execution patterns.
- **Session Storage**:
  - Analyzes key-value pairs from active browsing sessions.

## Workflow
1. **Initialization**:
   - Parses inputs and sets up dependencies.
2. **Artifact Location**:
   - Identifies browser profiles (e.g., `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\User Data\Default`).
3. **Data Extraction**:
   - Uses SQL queries and JSON parsing.
4. **Decryption**:
   - Decrypts sensitive data using the browser's encryption keys.
5. **Output Generation**:
   - Saves data in CSV and JSON formats.
6. **Prefetch Analysis**:
   - Extracts execution times, accessed files, and metadata.

## Troubleshooting
### PECmd Issues
- Ensure compatibility with Prefetch files.
- Verify files are not corrupted or locked.

### Python Dependency Issues
- Update libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.

### Go Application Issues
- Verify Go installation with `go version`.
- Resolve dependency issues with `go mod tidy`.

### Output Errors
- Verify input paths and ensure data files are not corrupted.

## Best Practices
- Use the tool in an isolated forensic environment.
- Secure sensitive data during analysis.
- Keep dependencies and tools updated for optimal performance.

## Conclusion
The **Browser Artifacts Forensics Tool** offers an efficient and robust solution for analyzing artifacts from privacy-centric browsers. Its comprehensive feature set, including Prefetch analysis and data extraction, empowers forensic investigators to uncover critical evidence while maintaining data integrity.
